## About project
The first project is a resume. 
The project is divided into elements in accordance with the BEM methodology 
(component layout).

I have used the following technologies here:
- pug, 
- sass, 
- webpack 
- and best practices

### for SASS BUILD:
`sass ./src/styles.sass ./build/styles.css`

### for PUG BUILD:
`sudo npm install pug`

`sudo npm install pug-cli -g`

`pug index.pug`

### Others dependencies for WebPack:
`npm install --global yarn`

`sudo npm i sass-loader -g`

`sudo npm install --global yarn`

`yarn add html-webpack-template-pug`

For other dependencies see:
**/package.json**

### WebPack:
to build, run:

`npm run build`

### Local server:
and you can also run a local server:

`npx serve`
